\begin{abstract}

Data centers supporting host a diverse range of heterogenous traffic with varying throughput and delay requirements. Transport layer protocols power data center traffic must be able to tolerate bursts of traffic, provide low latencies for time-sensitive traffic, all while maintaining high throughput for large data flows. Several modifications to the TCP protocol have been proposed to address shortcomings in conventional TCP congestion control algorithms, which relies on packet loss as a metric of network congestion. Data Center TCP, Incast TCP, Multipath TCP, and TCP BBR are discussed, and a replication of selected results related to DCTCP performance are presented.
