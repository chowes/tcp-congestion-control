\begin{abstract}

Data centers supporting modern large-scale applications must host a diverse range of heterogeneous traffic with strict throughput and delay requirements. Transport layer protocols facilitating data center traffic must be able to tolerate intense bursts of many-to-one traffic, provide low latencies for time-sensitive requests, all while maintaining high throughput for large data flows. TCP makes up the majority of traffic in modern data centers, though a number of performance impairments suggest that traditional TCP congestion control mechanisms are ill-suited to the demands of a data center environment. Several modifications to the TCP protocol have been proposed to address shortcomings in conventional TCP congestion control algorithms, which rely on packet loss as a metric of network congestion. This paper presents an overview of traffic problems in modern data centers, as well as a number of proposed modifications to TCP's congestion control mechanisms aimed at improving the performance of TCP for typical data center communication patterns. Finally, key results related to the performance of Data Center TCP are replicated and discussed.
