\section{TCP Congestion Control}

% why is this an issue?

\section{Data Center TCP}

Modern distributed cloud applications rely heavily on the \emph{partition/aggregate} design pattern, in which an application is broken in into hierarchical layers and time-sensitive requests at higher layers are divided and delegated to workers in the lower layers. Workers perform some component of a task and return a result to an aggregator, which is combined with results from other workers and passed back up through the hierarchy. 

Data center TCP (DCTCP) attempts to address the problem of latency in partition/aggregate traffic by reducing queue length without affecting throughput for large TCP flows.

\subsection{Reproducing DCTCP Results}

\subsubsection{Method}

DCTCP results were reproduced using the Mininet network emulator running on Ubuntu 12.04 with the DCTCP kernel patch.

\section{TCP BBR}

TCP BBR is a congestion control algorithm based on bottleneck bandwidth and round-trip propogation time.s
